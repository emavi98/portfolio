              My developer career started with a great emphasis on e-commerce
              and ERP Frontend Developer and I even worked on the development of
              many companys . Later on I specialized in React and it&apos;s
              ecosystem. I really like problem-solving in general and am
              addicted to the feeling of solving them.

              Besides Web Development I have a diverse work experience ranging
              from administrative, accounting, helpdesk support, devops to Tech
              Companies.

              I&apos;m no stranger to multiculturalism and I appreciate
              diversity as well as discovering and experiencing new cultures.
