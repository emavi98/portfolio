## Description

Developed with Next.js using Static Site Generation. Dynamic pages for
projects and blog posts. Blog posts and project details written in markdown and rendered with
react-markdown. Framer motion, AOS and Swiper for the "eye candy".

## Key takeaways

I've wanted to build a cool, or at least presentable, Portfolio-Blog for a while now. Since I've been working a lot with Next.js lately, I figured it would be a great idea to build this portfolio using Next.js instead of some plain html/css/js. And since I didn't want to pay for hosting just right now, Github Pages should do the trick.
<br />
<br />
It turned out to be bigger and more complex than expected. You can check out my blog post [<ins>here</ins>](/portfolio/posts/static-site-to-github-pages) where I go into detail about building and deploying this portfolio.

## Structure

See below the diagram for the project.
